##### GUI written in Visual C++ by Alexandre Matov in 2001 for a fast line detection computer vision software based on combinatorial optimization 

##### algorithms estimating piecewise linear models (A linear system is constructed with the coordinates of all contour points in the image as coefficients

##### and the line parameters as unknowns. The resulting linear system is then partitioned into a close-to-minimum number of consistent subsystems using  

##### a greedy strategy based on a thermal variant of the perceptron algorithm. While the partition into consistent subsystems yields the classification of 

##### the corresponding image points into a close-to-minimum number of lines; DOI:10.1007/3-540-45129-3_37).
